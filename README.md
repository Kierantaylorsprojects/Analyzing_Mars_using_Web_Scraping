# Analyzing_Mars_using_Web_Scraping

## Part 1:  

- Scraped Titles and Previewed Text from Mars News. 

- Automated browsing (using Splinter) was used to visit the Mars news site, and the HTML code was extracted (with Beautiful Soup). 

- The titles and preview text of the news articles were scraped and extracted. 

- The scraped information was stored in the specified Python data structureâ€”specifically, a list of dictionaries. 

## Part 2: 

- Scraped and Analyzed Mars Weather Data.  

- HTML table was extracted into a Pandas DataFrame. 

## The data was then analyzed to answer the following questions: 

1. How many months exist on Mars? 

2. How many Martian days' worth of data are there? 

3. The data was analyzed to answer the following questions, and a data visualization was created to support each answer: 

4. Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest? 

5. Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest? 

6. How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year? 

## The DataFrame was  then exported into a CSV file.
